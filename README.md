 hi!!you might see me some places but you can call me water. my pony is a type of bug that feeds on a bad type of bug. i am called a corbel ! i made this up, corels usually are named emojis, if someone has the same emoji, add a symbol or number or letter! we corbels feed on the bad bug horrels, horells are often named bad things for example: annoying, hideous, ugly. if any bad names are taken, use symbols,numbers and letters. these bugs are bad because they usually poison alot of things
